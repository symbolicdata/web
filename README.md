# The SymbolicData Web Pages

This SD repo contains code of a demo website with prototypical implementations
to be enrolled at a site.  To have the complete infrastructure running you
should also set up a Virtuoso based RDF Store with the project's data and run
the SPARQL endpoint.

Note that this code was running until 2020 at symbolicdata.org hosted at
Leipzig university but removed from the web during the shutdown of the
project.  It is provided in this repo solely "as is".

The directories "Papers" and "Presentations" were moved to the SD github pages
to guarantee their operation independent from this web store.
