It focuses on the representation theory of complex semisimple (reductive) Lie groups and algebras, and on the structure of their Weyl groups and root systems.  LiE does not compute directly with elements of the Lie groups and algebras themselves; it rather computes with weights, roots, characters and similar objects. Some specialities of LiE are: tensor product decompositions, branching to subgroups, Weyl group orbits, reduced elements in Weyl groups, distinguished coset representatives and much more. These operations have been compiled into the program which results in fast execution: typically one or two orders of magnitude faster than similar programs written in a general purpose program.  The LiE programming language makes it possible to customise and extend the package with more mathematical functions. A user manual is provided containing many examples.  LiE establishes an interactive environment from which commands can be given that involve basic programming primitives and powerful built-in functions. These commands are read by an interpreter built into the package and passed to the core of the system. This core consists of programs representing some 100 mathematical functions. The interpreter offers on-line facilities which explain operations and functions, and which give background information about Lie group theoretical concepts and about currently valid definitions and values.

Its design is revolutionary in a sense that contrary to other CAS it does not try to provide extensive algebraic capabilities and a simple programming language but instead accepts a given language (C++) and extends it by a set of algebraic capabilities.

    dct:description "The use of computers in near-ring theory This paper describes the facilities available in a computer system developed by the authors at the University of Linz, Austria, for investigating near-rings. The use of computers to investigate near-rings goes back a long way to the mid 1960s and J. R. Clay. This report opens up a new era in this field by providing a system SONATA (System Of Near-rings And Their Applications) based on GAP, the well known powerful program for groups. A description of the methods used is given. The amount of information that can be obtained is very substantial and can deal with very large near-rings, in some cases up to 10^50 elements in size. Several examples of possible use are described. This is a very useful major achievement. " ;

Macaulay2 includes core algorithms for computing Gröbner bases and graded or multi-graded free resolutions of modules over quotient rings of graded or multi-graded polynomial rings with a monomial ordering. The core algorithms are accessible through a versatile high level interpreted user language with a powerful debugger supporting the creation of new classes of mathematical objects and the installation of methods for computing specifically with them. Macaulay2 can compute Betti numbers, Ext, cohomology of coherent sheaves on projective varieties, primary decomposition of ideals, integral closure of rings, and more. " ;

It provides a mathematically rigorous environment for defining and working with structures such as groups, rings, fields, modules, algebras, schemes, curves, graphs, designs, codes and many others. Magma also supports a number of databases designed to aid computational research in those areas of mathematics which are algebraic in nature. The overview provides a summary of Magma's main features.  One of the aims whilst developing Magma is to maintain extensive documentation describing the features of the system. This handbook is available online. The documentation section should help introduce new users to the Magma language.  Magma is distributed by the Computational Algebra Group at the University of Sydney. Its development has benefited enormously from contributions made by many members of the mathematical community. We encourage all users to report any bugs they find; regular patch fixes are available from the downloads section." ;

Following the traditional lines of considering homomorphic images of groups and double cosets of groups operating on sets, new methods for colouring orbits and determining automorphism groups are presented in order to construct all connected multigraphs with given degrees of vertices and forbidden or prescribed sets of subgraphs (algorithm MOLGEN).par The algorithm relies on algebraic methods rather than combinatorial considerations and allows to construct molecular graphs with given properties of considerable size and complexity, as the numerical results presented in the paper show. Thus, with MOLGEN, there is available a new successful expert system for the structural analysis of chemical compounds. " ;

It started out in 1990 as a Macsyma code written by Hagen Eck and Sepp Küblbeck which could produce tree-level and one-loop diagrams in the Standard Model [Kü90], but soon got ported to the Mathematica platform. In 1995, Hagen Eck designed the second version to be a fully general diagram generator. To achieve this, he implemented some decisive new ideas [Eck95], the most important one being the generation of diagrams in three levels. The program was taken up again in 1998 by Thomas Hahn who developed version 2.2. The well-designed conceptual framework was kept, but the actual code was reprogrammed almost entirely to make it more efﬁcient and a user-friendly topology editor was added. The current version 3 features a completely new rendering engine for PostScript and LATEX, together with full support of the Mathematica Frontend’s graphical capabilities. It is also no longer dependent on the X platform for topology editing. " ;
