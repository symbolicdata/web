<p>The following list of academic people working in Computer Algebra is
extracted from the SymbolicData <a href="http://symbolicdata.org/Data/People/"
>CASN People Database</a>.  </p>

<p>The CASN Database contains more than 1000 instances of foaf:Person (as of
Febr. 2016).  In 2014 we identified in a joint effort with ZBMath (Wolfram
Sperber) the author strings of 347 persons within the author disambiguation
system of the Zentralblatt.  </p>

<p>For performance reasons the output is restricted to about 20 entries (100
RDF triples).  Use HTTP Get Parameter as in
<code>info/people.php?name=G&affil=J</code> to display available information
about people with foaf:name containing the string "G" and sd:affiliation
containing the string "J". The search is case insensitive.</p>
